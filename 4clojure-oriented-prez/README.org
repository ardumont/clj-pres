* What's this?

Material for a clojure presentation with 4clojure.com as a support.

The final picture is in =build/prez.png=, please [[https://github.com/denlab/clj-pres/raw/master/4clojure-oriented-prez/build/prez.png][check it]] before
anything else.

The final image is intended to be viewed with [[prezi.com]], it will allow
to build a path of the viewing of the image in advance (zooming,
dezooming, ...).

To get an idea of what it could look like, check a previous
presentation of mine
http://prezi.com/kdsbpq1t8dm8/jenkins-cleanup-2/. It was done exacly
with the same process than this presentation: All authoring in yed +
prezi at the end for the viewing.

* How to use the sources? 

In order to edit the doc, you need: 

- [[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html][yEd]]

- Install yEd, launch it.

- Import the custom palette in it: =src/prez.clj.yed.palette.graphml=.

- Then open =src/prez.graphml=, you should be able to edit it.

* Notes

- Please note that there is a image diffing functionality in github,
  that allow to check the difference between versions of an image. We
  should use it!
